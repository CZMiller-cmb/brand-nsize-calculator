Brand N-size Calculator
<br>Created by: Cameron Miller
<be>Last updated: 05.30.24

This tool can be used to estimate the number of exposures per brand when the following parameters are known:
- Total expected sample size
- Number of brands in study
- Estimated awareness level for each brand
- Number of brands assigned per respondent
- Assignment method (least fill or randomization)
- Brand prioritization (if any)

In the 'User inputs' section, these parameters are entered as prompted and the script outputs the following in the 'Run' section, taking into consideration the user's settings:
- The estimated number of exposures for each brand
- The number of respondents assigned 0 brands, 1 brand, 2 brands, etc. up to the number of possible brands assigned

No revisions to actual code are needed in the 'User inputs' section, and nothing should be inputted/changed at all in the 'Setup' or 'Run' sections

Instructions:
- To begin using the tool, select 'Run all cells' from the 'Run' dropdown menu
- Answer each prompt in the 'User inputs' section, hitting enter to submit
- After answering all prompts, the code will execute and results will be viewable at the bottom of the 'Run' section
- To reset the tool, select 'Restart Kernel and Clear Outputs of All Cells' from the 'Kernel' menu
